    <img src="ship.jpg" alt="Ship Image">

    <p>
      A <strong>ship</strong> is a large watercraft that travels across seas and oceans to transport people or goods. Ships are essential for global trade and naval operations. Unlike boats, ships are typically larger and designed for long-distance travel and heavy-duty use.
    </p>

    <p>Types of ships include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cargo Ships</strong> – Used to transport goods and containers</li>
      <li><strong>Passenger Ships</strong> – Like cruise ships and ferries</li>
      <li><strong>Tankers</strong> – Transport liquids like oil or chemicals</li>
      <li><strong>Naval Ships</strong> – Used by the military</li>
      <li><strong>Fishing Vessels</strong> – For catching seafood</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ships are powered by engines, turbines, or sails and are built to withstand various sea conditions. Modern ships are equipped with advanced technology for navigation, safety, and communication.
