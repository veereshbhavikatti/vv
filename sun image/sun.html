    <h1>About the Sun</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>Sun</strong> is a massive ball of burning gases and plasma located at the center of our solar system. 
      It provides the light and heat necessary for life on Earth and plays a crucial role in the orbits of planets, asteroids, and comets.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is mostly made up of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%). The Sun's surface temperature is around <strong>5,500°C (9,932°F)</strong>,
      while the core can reach over <strong>15 million°C</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>
      The energy from the Sun is created by a process called <strong>nuclear fusion</strong>, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium and release energy.
      This energy takes thousands of years to reach the surface and only about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the Sun, life would not exist on Earth. It drives our climate, weather, ocean currents, and helps plants grow through photosynthesis.
